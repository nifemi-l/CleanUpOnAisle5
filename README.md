# Clear Directory Script

A simple Python script to clear files from a directory. It validates the directory path, skips `desktop.ini` and `.DS_Store`, and logs deleted files. Made for quick personal use.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Provide the directory path when prompted.

### Example
```bash
Enter path to directory
(Enter 'e' to exit)
: /path/to/directory

**WET FLOOR -- CAUTION**
/path/to/directory/file1.txt was successfully deleted.

/path/to/directory/file2.txt was successfully deleted.

Process completed in 0.01 seconds.
